Graph Space Model (WSDM'15)

This is the code for the graph document model ss described in "A Semantic Graph based Language Model for Question Retrieval". In Proceedings of WSDM'15, pp. 543-552, ACM, 2015.

Note that this code is not really running out of the box. It's more a resource for you to copy&paste some Java code.

Also third party dataset are not provided, as I can not redistributed those without permission. Folders where third-party data are need.
